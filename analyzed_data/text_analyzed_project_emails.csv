In doing this , I need the model to be able to pull historical curves from Oracle by basis location. It will need to pull Interest Rate , Gas Daily , Balance of the month (Swing Swap) , Nymex and Basis. Once all of the pricing curves are pulled , the model will make daily decisions based on price relative to each other to buy , sell or hold.

To be honest , I feel a good deal more comfortable that there is already a framework and initiative in place - its very easy to feel like the ""angry lone voice"" in an effort like this - fortunately the practitioners of the art of risk management generally travel in a similar direction !

"Richard Following our meeting I have been discussing the voice recording requirements with other members of the project team , and I need to correct one piece of information I supplied to you. Regarding the recording of internal calls , it is possible to not record calls made on the Lucent digital phones internally , but ALL calls made on turrets (the phones the traders use) would have to be recorded , whether internal or external. This is due to the way in which the voice recording system must be connected to the turret system. Therefore , could you assume when considering what the corporate requirements are that we cannot exclude internal calls. My apologies for this mistake , we are going to investigate the development of a solution to this problem with the vendors under consideration.

The file confirms that someone in Risk Management put this deal on hold in November. I talked to Jason by phone last night and he confirmed that this is what happened. I had placed calls to Frost since working on the project but the lawyer did not rush to call since he has been out of the office until their business folks started pressing them this week. So , I completed a legal review & figured out what the remaining issues are that need to be resolved with counsel. (One of which was a convulated SEC issue that we figured out last night). I sent Brian a final draft and he is implementing those changes in a draft for his counsel. His counsel is out of the office until Monday but Brian put us in contact. I would predict that we will settle on the final terms on Monday , make minor changes to the final draft and get it executed by then.

No - but they are probably a good candidate for the restructuring group. They were originally 9 barges that were owned by CALME (D. Haug) and were being shopped around Enron for a home. Some of them went to a power project in Nigeria and now their are two of them left without a home. Last year they were being considered for a LIPA deal on Long Island that was orginally proposed by R. Maffett/R. Tapscott. Janet D. was working on this deal before she left for EES - but I don't think she made any further progress.

Attached is a file showing depreciation for NNG Commercial after excluding depreciation for the capital dollars associated with rate case settlement (lines 13-16). The 2002 depreciation is calculated to be $4.379 million. I think philosophically it s a good idea to track capital projects within NNG Commercial based on the life of the contracts used to justify the project. I don't think Neubauer is quite there yet. My concern is that we have developed an IBIT target for 2002 by using a 2001 number that does not include depreciation. It seems that we ought to offset the 01 starting point by the amount of the 02 depreciation.

"l..carson@enron.com l..carson@enron.com Louise , Attached is a new table derived from the list we reviewed on Thursday. This table , combined with the BoD approved Transaction Approval Process (TAP) on the RAC Website (rac.corp.enron.com) , should provide originators in the Americas with a roadmap for seeking spending approval and indicate where authority and responsibility lies for such approval. (FYI , the TAP is likely to change at the next board meeting--I'll send you a revised version next week.) The next step is an initiative to improve spending controls by linking DASH approved levels to the Accounting and Treasury systems. Rick Carson will be heading up this project and coordinating with Accounting and Treasury for support. Please distribute this as you see fit within your team. Let me know if any changes are required.

"-----Original Message----- Mark - in answer to your questions , the restructuring of the ownership chain for the Electrobolt power project is being done at OPIC's request - to make it easier for OPIC to exercise its remedies under the contemplated project financing structure. The Americas tax team will also realize a few efficiencies. We have obtained consents from our construction lenders to finalize the restructuring before OPIC comes in later this year. The attached slides show the steps. The top tier ""Brazilian Power Development Trust"" is a Delaware business trust with a 97/3 structure in which John Hancock is the equity. The debt is syndicated; WestLB is the Lender Agent. This restructuring does not increase any risks to Enron , the lending banks , or the equity.

I trade power in the Calgary office and also manage some trading decision support work (similar to Dave's group , but smaller in scale). We are very interested in pulling EOL prices real-time as a number of our products are functions of other EOL products. From talking to Dave , it seems that currently TIBCO is used to push eol price changes to clients , but that this will be discontinued in the near future in favor of rapid polling for price changes from a db. Do you have time to bring us up to speed on your recommended approach for monitoring EOL price changes ?

"Hello everyone , We have started an exciting project and would like to let everyone know about it and hopefully get some help with it. We are asking people to donate their aluminum cans and the proceeds will be used to recycle a house for Habitat For Humanity. Monday morning between 6 and 8 am on channel 26 , they are airing an article about the project. It should be an interesting article. They have interviewed Dave Daniel's , Director of Development for Habitat , me inside the trailer where we put the cans and a woman that is receiving a house. The Houston area is throwing away enough aluminum cans to sponsor 116 houses. We only recycle 51% of the cans sold. It takes 95% less energy to recycle than to mine and produce new.
